# DRM are EVIL (+1)

My wife bought about 500€ (at least) of TV Shows on iTunes. She bought the first season of Battlestar Gallactica in english (she notified the language after the dowload). DRM make it impossible to play it with french sub-titles. 

<div class="encadre">
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 5em"><strong>WTF?</strong></p>
</div>

Result, my wife would never buy any TV show on iTunes. She don't like DVD because it is not as easy to buy and to use than to simply download episodes.

<div class="encadre">
Therefore far less money for you EVIL Copyrighter!!!!!
</div>

My wife won't see these episodes.<br/>
This is a <strong>'LOSE-LOSE'</strong> cooperation.
