It is unbelievable you cannot filter your call with an iPhone! The only reason I see for that is a negotiation with phone operator to force users to get phone advertising. It is simple unacceptable.

I'm a λ iPhone's user. The only way to filter your call and to manage blacklist is to *jailbreak* your iPhone. And I don't want to do that. Then, if like me you find it unacceptable, just write a line to Apple: [http://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html](http://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html)
